		<h2>Emerald City Supporters</h2>
		<h4>About ECS</h4>
		<p>Emerald City Supporters (ECS) are a independent supporters group of Seattle Sounders FC. Our aim is to support our beloved Sounders and continue to create the best atmosphere in Major League Soccer. Look to the Brougham End to see and hear the ECS in action on gameday. The ECS focuses on uniting supporters based on their love of the Sounders, but also acts as an umbrella organization that incorporates supporter subgroups of all persuasions â€“ just as long as they are supporters of the Sounders.</p>  
		<p>If you are thinking of starting a group or need help please contact us via email (ecs@weareecs.com) or on our message boards. If you just want to join us, then come stand with the ECS, sing our songs, and participate in the displays.</p>
